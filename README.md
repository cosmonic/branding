Cosmonic branding guidelines implemented with native web components and deployed to GitHub Pages. Very simple, no fluffy styles (yet) beyond just the presentation of the guidelines.

If you install storybook via npm right now, it'll add over _1000_ more dependencies with almost 2 dozen deprecation warnings and _high_ security vulnerabilities. No thank you!
